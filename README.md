## Code details

This repository contains the code used in the manuscript and supporting informations. The details of the different R scripts is presented below:

* _1_GLMM_senescence_run_and_save_model_normalPrior.R_: Run the main GLMM looking at age-related variation in reproductive success in black-browed albatrosses. 
* _2_Extract_parameters_of_interest_from_model_output.R_: Extract the parameters of interest estimated by the GLMM (notably: age at onset of senescence, senescence rate, early-life probability of successful reproduction and probability of successful reproduction at the onset of senescence).
* _3_Figure2.R_: Code used to produce Figure 2.
* _4_Get_variance.R_: Extract the variance in parameters of interest. This code is used to produce Table 2.
* _5_Figure3.R_: Code used to produce Figure 3.
* _6_link_with_fitness.R_: Code used to investigate the link between lifetime reproductive success, onset and rate of senescence.
* _SupportingInformation_S1.R_: Code used to produce Supporting information S1. 
* _SupportingInformation_S3.R_: Code used to produce Supporting information S3. 
* _SupportingInformation_S4.R_: Code used to produce Supporting information S4. 
* _SupportingInformation_S5.R_: Code used to produce Supporting information S5. 
* _SupportingInformation_S6.R_: Code used to produce Supporting information S6.
